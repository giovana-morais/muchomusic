# Question Categorisation
Each question tests a set of understanding skills along several dimensions. Each dimension falls under one of two categories: knowledge and reasoning. 
* Knowledge refers to the ability to recognise pre-acquired musical concepts within a given music clip (e.g. recognising chord progression, recognising an instrument, etc.) 
* Reasoning refers to the ability to combine knowledge of several musical concepts and typically requires analysis, synthesis, and evaluation (e.g. use the combination of tempo recognition, chord quality and instrumentation to determine the mood of the clip)

## MUSICAL KNOWLEDGE DIMENSIONS
Musical knowledge includes both common concepts that are familiar to anyone, including people with no formal music education, and concepts acquired through music education (music literacy)
* Melody 
  * Identification of specific musical elements responsible for melody
  * Interval between two notes 
  * Contour (ascending, descending, scalar, arpeggiated)
  * Understanding of scale degrees and tonal relationships within melodies 
  * Ability to identify and analyse motifs, sequences, themes, and melodic development
* Harmony 
  * Identification of specific musical elements responsible for harmony
  * Chord quality (major, minor, diminished, augmented)
  * The function of a given chord within the harmonic progression (tonic, dominant, subdominant)
  * Cadences and harmonic rhythm. 
  * Harmonic Analysis: Analyzing the harmonic progression, chordal relationships, and tonal framework within a piece of music. 
* Metre and Rhythm 
  * Time signature
  * Tempo 
  * Rhythmic patterns
  * Identification of specific musical elements responsible for metre and rhythm
  * Rhythmic techniques (syncopation, polyrhythm, ostinato, etc.)
* Instrumentation 
  * To identify the instrument(s) playing 
  * To recognize the family of instruments (e.g., brass, woodwinds, strings) heard in the excerpt

  * Sound effects (natural sounds and everyday noises)
* Performance
  * Recording setup 
  * Live performance 
  * Vocal techniques (e.g. chanting, rapping, falsetto)
  * Dynamics (Variations of loudness)
  * Expressive techniques (dynamics, articulations) used in the excerpt
* Structure 
  * The presence of specific sections (e.g., exposition, development, recapitulation in a sonata-allegro form). 
  * Transitional passages or changes in thematic material within the excerpt 
  * Awareness of sectional divisions (segment type: intro, verse, chorus, etc.)

## MUSIC REASONING DIMENSIONS

* Mood and expression
  * Emotion, mood or atmosphere conveyed by the music
  * Identification of specific musical elements to convey a certain mood or expression (e.g. expressive performance, phrasing, dynamics)

  * Identification of sections, thematic material, and developmental processes
  * Temporal ordering of music events
  * Interaction between different musical elements
* Lyrics 
  * Content and theme of the lyrics 
  * Emotion, mood or atmosphere conveyed by the lyrics 
  * Primary language of the lyrics
* Genre and style
  * Recognize characteristics of various musical genres (e.g., jazz, blues, rock, classical)
  * Identify the musical style associated with the excerpt
* Historical and Cultural Context
