You are being invited to participate in a research study.
Before you decide whether or not you wish to participate in this study, it is important for you to understand why the
research is being done and what it will involve.
Please take time to read the following information carefully.

### What is the purpose of the study and what would taking part involve?

This survey seeks to validate answers to a set of multiple-choice questions about some music tracks.
Once validated, these question-answer pairs will form the basis for an evaluation benchmark used to assess musical
understanding of machine learning models. The survey should take 30 to 35 minutes. Only the answers you submit
will be collected, alongside the pre-survey information.

### Why am I being invited?

You are being invited to participate in this research study because you have a Prolific account and Prolific have
indicated that you meet our eligibility requirements.
You should not take part in this study if you are below 18 years of age, are not fluent in English, have hearing loss or
hearing difficulties.

### Do I have to take part?

This participant information sheet has been written to help you decide if you would like to take part.
It is up to you whether you wish to take part.
If you do decide to take part you will be free to withdraw at any time without needing to provide a reason, and with no
penalties or detrimental effects.

### What are the possible benefits of taking part?

By participating, you will contribute to research in the field of automatic music understanding and help researchers
evaluate models more robustly.

### What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?

There are two potential minor risks of taking part: the exposure to loud sounds if the headphones or speaker volume is
not adequately set; the potential exposure to sensitive content in the lyrics of some of the music in the study.

### Expenses and payments

You will be compensated via Prolific at a rate of £9/hour.

### What information about me will you be collecting?

Only the answers you submit will be collected, alongside the pre-survey information.

### How will my data be stored and who will have access to it?

Your data will be stored in fully anonymised format within secure Google Cloud Platform servers located in Belgium,
managed by Prolific.
See <https://researcher-help.prolific.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360009094594-Data-protection-and-privacy> for further
information.
Answers collected in the survey will be stored on a secure database server within the UK.

### When and how will my data be destroyed?

No data will be stored by the researchers, other than the answers provided to the survey, which are anonymised.
These will be kept and made public to be used as an evaluation benchmark and will not be destroyed.
Your Prolific ID will be stored until 12.04.2024 and will be removed after that date.

### How will my data be used and shared?

Data will be publicly shared as an open-access database in fully anonymised form.
